        <p><a href="https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi">Rofi</a> is a window switcher, application launcher and dmenu replacement, which
integrates nicely with tiling window managers. In versions 1.3.x and before themes were read from <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/X_resources">X
resources</a>. The recent upgrade to version 1.4.2 broke my custom
<a href="https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme">Arc-Dark</a> inspired theme. Here is how to migrate legacy themes to the new
format:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>rofi -config /path/to/old/themefile -dump-theme &gt; theme.rasi</code></pre>
<!--more-->
<p>In case you are interested in the Arc-Dark theme I am using, check my
<a href="https://github.com/woefe/dotfiles/blob/master/rofi/.config/rofi/ArcDark.rasi">dotfiles</a>. Alternatively you might be
able to get it from the <a href="https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi-themes">Rofi Themes Repo</a>, if they accept my pull
request. The theme was first contributed to the theme repo by <a href="https://github.com/leofa">Faruk Ünver</a>, but got lost when
the themes were restructured.</p>
<p>It took me quite some time to figure out the command above, because at a first glance it seems like there is a different
method to convert legacy themes. There is a
<a href="https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi/blob/next/script/rofi-convert-theme.sh">script</a> that is supposed to convert
legacy themes to the new format. However, this script generated a theme file, which could not be parsed by Rofi. After
digging around some more in Rofi’s project files, I found the <code>convert_old_theme_test.sh</code> test script, which contains
the command from above.</p>
