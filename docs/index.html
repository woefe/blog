        <h1><a href="./posts/bootstrap_zsh.html">How to bootstrap your Zsh config with zplug</a></h1>
        
            <p><p>Recently, I spent some (probably too much) time tweaking my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell">Zsh</a> configuration.
The results of my efforts are the three Zsh plugins <a href="https://github.com/woefe/wbase.zsh">wbase.zsh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/woefe/git-prompt.zsh">git-prompt.zsh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/woefe/vi-mode.zsh">vi-mode.zsh</a> that are now available for anyone.
In this post I will explain how you can use the plugin manager <a href="https://github.com/zplug/zplug">zplug</a> together with my plugins to bootstrap your own config.
One note before we start: for the best experience, check that your terminal supports 256 colors or more.
You can do that with the <code>tput colors</code> command.</p>

            <p><p>A few weeks ago I revisited the DNS cache poisoning attack discovered by Dan Kaminsky in 2008.
Implementing the attack requires some fairly low-level manipulation of DNS packets.
Fortunately, we have <a href="https://scapy.net/">Scapy</a>, which makes packet manipulation easy and accessible from Python.
But at first the performance of my script was so bad that I could not carry out the attack (maybe I just never waited long enough).
In this post I want to record my journey that led to a faster and faster Scapy script.</p>

But what about external monitors?
Can I adjust the brightness without fiddling with the on-screen menu?</p>

            <p><p>On many systems Termiteâ€™s terminfo is not available by default. Thatâ€™s a problem since you cannot start ncurses apps,
when the terminfo is missing. I usually run into this problem when I try to ssh into a newly installed machine. Here is
a one-liner to fix the issue (you have to run this command on the remote, not you local machine!).</p>

            <p><p><a href="https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi">Rofi</a> is a window switcher, application launcher and dmenu replacement, which
integrates nicely with tiling window managers. In versions 1.3.x and before themes were read from <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/X_resources">X
resources</a>. The recent upgrade to version 1.4.2 broke my custom
<a href="https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme">Arc-Dark</a> inspired theme. Here is how to migrate legacy themes to the new
format:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>rofi -config /path/to/old/themefile -dump-theme &gt; theme.rasi</code></pre>

            <p><p>Arch Linuxâ€™ package manager <strong>pacman</strong> stores all downloaded packages in <code>/var/cache/pacman/pkg</code>.
This cache does not get cleaned automatically and pacman keeps adding new archives with every single system update.
If you forget about the pacman cache for a couple of months it takes up more and more space.
I recently freed over 12GB on my SSD by running the cleanup commands listed below.</p>

            <p><p>I finally solved the problem that I could not access my home computer, when I am not at home. In many cases the easiest
solution is to forward a port on the home router and run a SSH daemon on the home computer. However, it is not possible
for me to forward ports to the public internet. I got around this issue by setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
using the <a href="https://tinc-vpn.org">tinc</a> VPN daemon. tinc is one of <a href="http://tinc-vpn.org/vpnlinks/">many</a> VPN solutions
available on GNU/Linux. It is simple and easy to set up, especially when comparing it to OpenVPN, which has an enormous
amount of features and configuration options.</p>

            <p><p>I recently added the Bookmarks app to my ownCloud installation. This app keeps a simple list of bookmarks synced across
my computers. The Bookmarks app provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> to add new bookmarks
easily. But there is a problem with using the bookmarklet: I have to click on it! And therefore I have to display the
bookmarks bar or search for the bookmarklet in the bookmarks menu. I donâ€™t like both approaches for following reasons:
The bookmark bar eats too much space on my small notebook screen and searching for the bookmarklet in the menu takes too
long.</p>
